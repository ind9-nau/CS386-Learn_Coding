## 1. Description
CodeHub is a free, self-paced programming education web-application designed to teach coding to those with no experience. The primary features of CodeHub include allowing users to register and login. Once the user has an account, they are directed to a nice, simplistic homepage that informs users about the application. CodeHub has tabs on the top of the page for navigating from the homepage to a profile, Q&A, and courses. In the courses, the user can take a computer literacy quiz and/or navigate between Python and Web Development courses, each with one beginner level course with instructions and an integrated IDE. The user can change their username, password, and phone number on their profile. 

CodeHub is still in the early stages of development and is available to select users. This application offers a simplistic interface that is easy to navigate, and users can personalize their profile. In future implementations, CodeHub will have a Question-and-Answer Forum where they can communicate with other users and be able to upload a profile picture. In addition to being able to customize their profiles, users will be able to earn achievements based on their performance in courses and participation in the Q&A forum. Users will also have the option to opt for email reminders.
