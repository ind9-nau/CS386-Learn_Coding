## Implementation 1  

### 1. Introduction

  CodeHub is a free, self-paced programming education web-application designed to teach coding to those with no experience. The primary features of CodeHub include 
allowing users to register and login. Once the user has an account, they are directed to a nice, simplistic homepage that informs users about the application. CodeHub 
has tabs on the top of the page for navigating from the homepage to a profile, Q&A, and courses. In the courses, the user can take a computer literacy quiz and/or 
navigate between Python and Web Development courses, each with one beginner level course with instructions and an integrated IDE. The user can change their username, 
password, and phone number on their profile. 

  CodeHub is still in the early stages of development and is available to select users. This application offers a simplistic interface that is easy to navigate, and users 
can personalize their profile. In future implementations, CodeHub will have a Question-and-Answer Forum where they can communicate with other users and be able to upload
a profile picture. In addition to being able to customize their profiles, users will be able to earn achievements based on their performance in courses and participation 
in the Q&A forum. Users will also have the option to opt for email reminders.

### 3. Tests

3.1.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.):  

In order to develop our tests, we used Visual Studio’s Microsoft Unit Testing Frameworks. 

3.1.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.

### 5. Code Quality 

Our team already had similar coding styles as we are all in or have taken the same computer science courses with similar professors. This made it very easy to adapt 
the following policies and conventions. To maintain quality, we ensured that changes pushed to the repository had an appropriate amount of commenting and that the 
code that the forked repositories fetched the master repository so that there would not be conflicts when pushing changes. To avoid overly complex changes, we limited 
the amount of conditional testing, specifically the number of operators. Aside from commenting and complexity checks, as a team we maintained quality by ensuring that 
there was no duplication and that the code written was straightforward.  

### 6. Lessons Learned

Coming from everything we learned from Implementation 1, our team knew more of what challenges we could face and saw opportunities to improve. Last time, our main 
struggle was time since we did not realize how long it would take to implement our requirements. This time, we made sure to meet more often and with enough time before
the delivery was due to make sure everything was finished and turned in before the weekend. Fortunately, this time around we were all more comfortable working with 
Visual Studio and struggled less to accomplish our tasks, which made working easier and faster. Because we worked on Design before this deliverable, we had a better 
picture of where our project was going. If we were to continue with this project, we would like to implement all our desired requirements and make sure that all that
we have now is ready to be made public.
