# Verification and Validation #
## 1. Description ##
CodeHub is a free, self-paced programming education web-application designed to teach coding to those with no experience. The primary features of CodeHub include allowing users to register and login. Once the user has an account, they are directed to a nice, simplistic homepage that informs users about the application. CodeHub has tabs on the top of the page for navigating from the homepage to a profile, Q&A, and courses. In the courses, the user can take a computer literacy quiz and/or navigate between Python and Web Development courses, each with one beginner level course with instructions and an integrated IDE. The user can change their username, password, and phone number on their profile. 

CodeHub is still in the early stages of development and is available to select users. This application offers a simplistic interface that is easy to navigate, and users can personalize their profile. In future implementations, CodeHub will have a Question-and-Answer Forum where they can communicate with other users and be able to upload a profile picture. In addition to being able to customize their profiles, users will be able to earn achievements based on their performance in courses and participation in the Q&A forum. Users will also have the option to opt for email reminders.

## 2. Verification (tests) ## 

Verification aims to ensure that you correctly developed the product. 

### 2.1. Unit test ###

A unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a component isolated from the rest of the system. For this deliverable, show an example of unit test that uses mock objects to isolate the class from the rest of the system.  

#### 2.1.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.):  ####
In order to develop our tests, we used Visual Studio’s Microsoft Unit Testing Frameworks. Currently this test insures the code builds and runs correctly. It also pings trinket to make sure the website is up and running and our IDEs will work correctly.

#### 2.1.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.  ####

**GitHub Link:** https://github.com/ind9-nau/CS386-Learn_Coding/tree/main/CodeHubTests

#### 2.1.3. A print screen showing the result of the unit tests execution.  ####

### 2.2. Acceptance test  ###

An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:  

#### 2.2.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.): 

#### 2.2.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are located. 

#### 2.2.3. An example of an acceptance test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the test and an explanation about the tested feature. 

#### 2.2.4. A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution.  

## 3. Validation (user evaluation) ## 

Validation aims to ensure that you developed the right product. In the beginning of the semester, you talked to the clients/potential users to understand their needs. Now it is time to check if you are on the right track by conducting some user evaluation on the actual system. Include in this deliverable the following information:

### Reflections: ###

#### Name: Nicole  ####

She liked the idea and said it has potential. Liked the courses tabs but wasn’t a fan of the scrolling instructions at the bottom of the IDEs in projects. Commented on the colors and ease of use when registering and in general. Mentioned that she personally wouldn’t use it as she does not do a lot of coding but if it had other courses related to the ones in school (CS122) it could be helpful. Also mention that improving the homepage and profile page would me it easier to use. 

#### Name: Chris  ####

Chris’ feedback touched on a lot of aspects of the website. He commented on the aesthetics of our website and liked the basic simple layout and color scheme. He found it quite easy to register and login but had some difficulty finding the user profile. Overall, he felt very strongly about more courses with different difficulty levels as it would be more useful to him and wanted more features to aid in coding and keeping track of progress. 

#### Name: Samantha ####

Samantha commented on the ease of use of the tabs and the simplicity of the page. She liked the setup but wanted to see more variety in the languages offered. She also mentioned that additional difficulty levels could be helpful since 3 categories might not be enough. She said it could be a helpful app in the future to help her refresh her coding knowledge. 

#### Summary: ####
After reviewing the information we gathered from these interviews, we see that a few common topics arose. Users reported that navigating the website, the computer literacy quiz, and the IDE’s worked well and they had to trouble with it. For future implementation, based on user input, we will be changing the way users access their profile. We will unlink the welcome message and have a separate place for users to click and access their profile. We also received comments about the level of difficulty and lack of programming languages to learn. We plan to add more advanced projects and more languages to appeal to a wider audience that may already know some beginner code. There was no learning curve to our system and users were able to pick it up very quickly. Most of the tasks we asked users to accomplish were performed as expected. They were able to register with an email and valid password, then login. All the users commented on ease of use when registering and logging in. There was some difficulty finding the user profile but once there, the users could easily navigate to change their email and password. They found the tabs were descriptive and were able to find, start, and run a project. Lastly, all users found the logout button and were able to log out. Despite the changes users wanted to see and falling short of a few features we wanted to implement, we met our initial value proposition and created a web application that was free, self-paced, and proved a place where users with no experience could practice and learn beginner level coding.
